Explanation of Changes and Considerations

    RadioInterface Class:
        Replaces socket: This is your abstraction layer for the radio hardware. You'd replace serial.Serial with the appropriate library for your specific radio module (e.g., spidev for SPI-based modules like nRF24L01, or a dedicated library for LoRa/XBee).
        send_packet: Now takes a destination_id, packet_type, and payload. It's crucial to implement proper packet framing (start/end delimiters, length fields, checksums) for reliable transmission over radio. I've added a very basic conceptual packet structure.
        receive_packet: Reads raw bytes from the serial port and attempts to reconstruct packets. This is simplified; a real implementation would need a robust state machine to parse incomplete packets, handle errors, and discard corrupted data.
        node_id: Each RadioNode has a unique ID, replacing the IP address/port concept for addressing.

    RadioNode Class (formerly Server):
        __init__: Now takes node_id, serial_port, and baud_rate. It initializes the RadioInterface.
        peer_data: Instead of client_data, this now stores data associated with other peers it has discovered or communicated with.
        _radio_listen_loop: Runs in a separate thread, constantly trying to receive packets from the RadioInterface.
        _discovery_broadcast_loop: A new thread that periodically broadcasts a "discovery beacon" (packet type 250) with its own node_id. This is how nodes find each other in a P2P radio network.
        _handle_incoming_packet: Replaces handle_client. It receives packets and determines the sender_id (which needs to be part of your radio packet header) and pkt_type.
        broadcast_data: This is no longer a simple socket.sendall. It now uses the radio.send_packet method, iterating through known peers and sending the packet. For true "broadcast," you'd send to a special broadcast ID (e.g., 255).
        No remove_client: In a P2P setting, "disconnection" is often inferred from inactivity (e.g., a peer hasn't sent a beacon in a while), rather than a TCP ConnectionResetError. You might implement a peer timeout mechanism.
        request_interpolation, request_differentiation, send_nmr_data, send_position_update: These are new methods for a node to initiate communication and send data to a specific destination node.

    Packet Types and Data Formats:
        I've slightly adjusted some type numbers and added a sender_id field to the start of the "payload" in the conceptual _pack_... functions. This is crucial for the receiving node to know who sent the data.
        Robustness: The provided _pack_ and _unpack_ functions are highly simplified. In a real-world scenario, you'd need to add:
            Checksums/CRCs: To detect corrupted packets.
            Acknowledgements (ACKs) and Retries: To ensure reliable delivery. TCP does this automatically; you'll need to implement it for radio.
            Flow Control: To prevent a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver or the radio channel.
            Packet Fragmentation/Reassembly: For sending data larger than the radio module's maximum packet size.

Next Steps for Implementation

    Choose Radio Hardware: This is the most critical first step. Popular options include:
        LoRa (Long Range): Good for long distances, low data rates.
        nRF24L01: Very cheap, short range, low power, 2.4 GHz.
        XBee: More expensive, but often comes with built-in networking capabilities and more robust modules.
        Custom RF Modules: For more advanced users.
    Find Python Library: Locate a Python library that interfaces with your chosen radio module (e.g., pyserial for modules connected via UART, or specific libraries for LoRa/nRF24L01).
    Implement RadioInterface: Based on the chosen hardware and library, fully implement send_packet and receive_packet with proper framing, error checking, and blocking/non-blocking behavior.
    Packet Structure Design: Define a clear, robust packet structure including:
        Start/End delimiters
        Sender ID
        Destination ID (or broadcast ID)
        Packet Type (your operation_code)
        Payload Length
        Payload Data
        Checksum/CRC
        Sequence numbers (for reliability and reordering)
    Reliability Layer: Implement a custom Application Layer Reliability if your chosen radio doesn't handle it (e.g., if you're just sending raw bytes). This would involve:
        Sending ACKs for received packets.
        Retransmitting unacknowledged packets.
        Handling duplicate packets.
        Buffering out-of-order packets.
    MAC Layer (Optional but Recommended): If your radio module doesn't have a built-in MAC, consider implementing a simple CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) to reduce collisions.
